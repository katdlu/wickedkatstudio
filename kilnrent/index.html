        <h1>KILN SHARE PROGRAM</h1>
        <p>If you need to fire your ceramics, I offer kiln space rental in my CB 140 S KITTEK top oven in Kolding (centrum).
An oven plate measures 51 cm, the oven is 69 cm high inside and can fire up to a maximum of 1320 degrees.</p>

<p>The price depends on the size of your work and whether it needs to be bisqued, glaze fired or both.
You can rent one or more plates, depending on your needs.</p> 

<ul>
  <li>BISQUE: 75 kr. per kiln shelf</li>
  <li>GLAZE FIRE: 125 kr. per kiln shelf  </li>
</ul>

<p>I usually fire bisque at 960 degrees and glazes at 1240 degrees.
This can be adjusted by agreement – but then most of the time you need be able to fill an entire kiln.
</p>
<p>Before I can fire for you, I must approve your materials. 
I do this because I want to take care of my kiln and my own and others' ceramics that may be included in the firing. 
You must therefore document both the clay and the glazes you use. 
</p>
<p>Please note that this is at your own risk. 
A lot can happen in a firing at these temperatures.
Items may burst, crack, glaze may run or behave differently than desired.
This is completely normal and part of the excitement of making ceramics.
Unfortunately, this does not affect the price.
